# LungCancerPrediction
Welcome to the LungCancer repository. This project was developed as part of the DSA312 module, with the aim to visualise and communicate key insights from the lung cancer survey.csv dataset, as well as develop a lung cancer prediction model. By analysing key characteristics and common symptoms of lung cancer, our prediction model provides users with information on their lung cancer risk levels.
