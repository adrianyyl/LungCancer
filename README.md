# LungCancerPrediction
Welcome to the **LungCancer** repository. This project was developed as part of the DSA312 module, with the aim to visualise and communicate key insights from the lung cancer survey.csv dataset, as well as develop a lung cancer prediction model. By analysing key characteristics and common symptoms of lung cancer, our prediction model provides users with information on their lung cancer risk levels.
